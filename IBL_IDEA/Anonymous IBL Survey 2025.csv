It seems that researchers do not have full access to information that may affect them or opportunities are not distributed equally. 

Sometimes, there is an impression that staff make decisions internally and do not necessarily want to discuss them with researchers. Instead, they seem to prefer researchers to be passive executors of their decisions. This is particularly unfair because some researchers are highly trained experts, and their input should be valued.","These rules can be interpreted differently, and sometimes one person in management decides how to execute the rule in a way that benefits them the most.","","no, IBL is not a democratic collaboration, it is very hierarchical","No","","There is an illusion that everyone can make suggestions, but in practice, only PIs and those attending ""closed"" meetings or being in good relationship with management have real power and impact.

The person doing that work is left behind (with career progress and publication), while the low-hanging fruit of publication is taken by others who do not spend their precious time on experiments and dealing with issues with IBL pipelines.

Additionally, there is still a problem with communication with staff and the use of developed tools or scripts. It often feels like these solutions have been specifically tailored for a single dataset or experimental design. It is disappointing that tools that are broadly advertised are difficult to adapt for other projects.

More opportunities to meet informally (online or in person). ","In theory, yes (as the important rules/policies have been written up), but I don't think most people are aware of them. E.g. authorship and data release policies are not clear to everyone, and have not been fit for purpose when it comes to smaller scale projects. So it's important to have periodic reminders about the policies, to have effective conflict resolution that is based on the policies, and to have active discussions with the whole community when they are not working properly.","I think most policies are covered, but they should be reviewed and in some cases overhauled.","There is a majority of people in IBL who clearly want to uphold high standards of work culture and whose conduct fits the policies laid out by IBL. That said, in practice, not everyone in IBL cares about the rules of conduct (as shown by past, often anonymous, reports of bullying and marginalisation). When this concerns senior people, the structure of IBL means that there is very little leverage to get them to change anything - it is often more convenient to keep the status quo, and to let individuals manage their slice of the pie the way they see fit.","No","","There are conduits for making suggestions to IBL as a whole, and these suggestions are often well received. But in practice, they often stall before any implementation, mainly because of a general lack of engagement and motivation from the community as a whole.","3","3","2","More engagement from PIs and researchers that claim scientific credit for the WG / TF's outputs. More scientific vision in general.","2","They only happen once in a blue moon, so they may not be useful at all anymore.","2","1","The reliability and transparency of the hardware/software support has improved relative to last year: the more robust approaches to updating code and detecting bugs (unit tests, code reviews, better documentation, etc) are a huge step forward. That said, there have still been many issues with iblrigv8 over the past year, some of which have impacted mouse training and the behavioural+neural data recorded. There still is a tendency to roll out updates without considering the impact that potential bugs could have on the science. This is fundamentally a testing coverage problem: some issues can only be found out after running real mice through real task protocols. In my opinion it would be better to properly simulate the task as part of the testing regime, and to roll out updates in rigs running less high-risk experiments first.","3","3","2","3","3","4","3","4","2","2","1","2","2","No, and I don't want one","","","","Writing papers;Programming/coding","3","1","The current reality of IBL is that most people are not engaged with the collaboration anymore. The primary scientific outputs of the consortium (the behaviour, brainwide map & prior papers) are now wrapped up, and most scientists involved in those have either moved on to personal projects or to different jobs altogether. There is a new generation of scientists that are doing smaller scale collaborative projects within IBL, which no longer fit under the term 'platform project' or 'personal project'. The way those collaborations should be formalised is still unclear, and may require ad hoc agreements rather than central policies. ","3","Yes. It isn't clear if the 'platform project' I am involved in actually falls under the definition of a platform paper. Therefore, we still don't have a clear agreement if and how first authorship should be attributed; if and how the people who originally conceived of the project should be credited.","No","A staff scientist with good programming skills as well as scientific interest. They could have a more active role in supporting the implementation of exploratory & confirmatory analyses on the neural data.","Quick-fire rounds of what people are currently working on (much like the staff's sprint reports, but for researchers).","Many researchers in IBL have voiced concerns over the years about how well their work in IBL, and the credit received for it, has prepared them for an academic career. The collaboration between 'theorists' and 'experimentalists' has had mixed success, and many people have felt that they've had to trade off their own scientific interests against the success of the platform projects. Individual scientific output, and general motivation has suffered as a result. There is no obvious solution to this, but it's important that their concerns are heard and that any future large-scale collaboration puts their interests first. ","Yes. Once a year is fine.
